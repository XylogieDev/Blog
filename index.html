          Hey, my name's Dan and this is my website. 
          <br> <br>
           I'm a 16 year old aspiring developer from the UK with a fascination in physics and maths, but also the programming side to these topics, because of this I am loking to focus a lot of time on simulations and other science-related projects. 
           <br> <br>
           This website will be my first acutal web-based project as my previous experience has been very light game design, cybersecurity and simple console applications for school. As a result, I am most comfortable with some of the most useless languages ever created:
           <ul>
            <li>Python (Ok maybe not that bad)</li>
            <li>Lua</li>
            <li>Visual Basic (This was for school and is almost comically useless)</li>
           </ul> 
           <p>Though I'm wildely inexperienced with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I'm extremely excited to become more and more familiar with them which should reflect in the changes this website undergoes.
            <br>
            Now, this website.
